# DevFactory

Welcome to the DevFactory project!

## Introduction

DevFactory is a Terraform-based project designed to streamline the setup and configuration of modern development environments on Azure. It uses a modular approach with consistent patterns to deploy and manage Azure resources, with a focus on Azure Dev Center and DevBox capabilities.

The initial north star for this project is to build a development factory represented in the following architecture diagram:

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each Azure resource type has its own module with consistent structure
- **Flexible Configuration**: Use variable files to create different resource combinations
- **Naming Standards**: Integrated Azure CAF naming conventions
- **Resource Association**: Seamless connection between related resources
- **Complete Examples**: Ready-to-use examples for various deployment scenarios

## Components

DevFactory currently automates the setup of the following components:

### Azure Dev Center Components

- Resource Groups
- Dev Centers
- DevBox Definitions
- Projects
- Environment Types
- Network Connections
- Galleries
- Catalogs

### Roadmap Components

- GitHub Enterprise Automation (organizations parameters, actions settings, etc.)
- GitHub Hosted Compute Networking
- Azure Kubernetes Services for GitHub Runners with Actions Runner Controller
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure DevBox

### AI foundations (roadmap)

- Azure Application Gateway
- Azure Container Apps
- Azure Container Registry
- Azure Kubernetes Services
- Azure Cognitive Services

## Quick Start

To get started with the DevFactory project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine, or Click on "Open in Codespace"
2. Login to your Azure Subscription using `az login`
3. Select an example configuration from the `examples` directory
4. Customize the variables in the selected `.tfvars` file
5. Initialize Terraform: `terraform init`
6. Plan your deployment: `terraform plan -var-file=configuration.tfvars`
7. Apply the configuration: `terraform apply -var-file=configuration.tfvars`

For detailed instructions, see our [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md).

### Development Environment

This project includes:
- **GitHub Codespaces Support**: Pre-configured dev container with all necessary tools
- **MCP Integration**: Model Context Protocol servers for Terraform and Azure for AI-assisted development

> **Note for Codespaces Users**: To use MCP features in GitHub Codespaces, switch to VS Code Insider version. See the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md) for detailed instructions.

## Documentation

The project includes comprehensive documentation to help you understand and use DevFactory effectively:

- [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting_started.md) - Instructions for setting up and deploying your first resources
- [Coding Conventions](docs/conventions.md) - Standards and best practices for the codebase
- [Module Guide](docs/module_guide.md) - Detailed information about each module's functionality and usage
- [GitHub Coding Agent Guide](docs/coding_agent.md) - Instructions for using the GitHub Coding Agent

## Requirements

- Terraform â‰¥ 1.12.1
- AzureCAF Provider ~> 1.2.0
- AzureAPI Provider ~> 2.0.0
- Azure CLI (latest version recommended)
- An active Azure subscription

## How to Use

DevFactory is designed with a modular approach. The root module (main.tf) is the entry point that orchestrates the creation of all resources, and you provide different variable files to control what gets deployed:

```bash
# Login to Azure
az login

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Deploy a simple resource group configuration
terraform plan -var-file=examples/resource_group/simple_case/configuration.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=examples/resource_group/simple_case/configuration.tfvars

# Deploy a dev center with devboxes
terraform plan -var-file=examples/dev_center/simple_case/configuration.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=examples/dev_center/simple_case/configuration.tfvars
```

For more complex scenarios, check out the examples in the `examples` directory. Each example demonstrates a specific use case and can be used as a starting point for your own configurations.

## Testing

DevFactory includes a comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests to validate all modules. For detailed testing instructions, including how to run tests, write new tests, and troubleshoot common issues, see the [Testing Guide](docs/testing.md).
